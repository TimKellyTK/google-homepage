# Google Homepage Rebuild with HTML and CSS

> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project is a HTML and CSS copy of the Google Homepage. To create the design, I used Webflow to visually code the HTML and CSS and debugged the code inside Visual Studio Code.

The borders, colours and pixel dimensions are not perfect but it was a good first step into HTML and CSS.

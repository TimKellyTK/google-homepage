# Google Homepage Rebuild with HTML and CSS
> From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

For this project, I used Webflow to recreate the HTML and CSS code for the Google Homepage, then exported and debugged the code inside visual code studio.

The borders, colours and pixel dimensions are not perfect for CSS but the project was a great introduction on recreating designs with HTML and CSS.
